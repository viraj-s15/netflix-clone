## This is a smaller project mostly because I wanted to try out Vite, a module bundler which is similar to create-react-app. 
## Anyhoo here is the link to the live demo: https://netflix-clone-21d9e.web.app
## (Clicking the image shows the trailer of the movie, some may not work because some of the names returned by the api are in a completely differently language. I may update that at some point to make it work)
## Below are a few images of the app itself
